  4. Underwriting checklist & red-flag scan.
  5. Submit; respond to conditions; close; set covenants reminders.

### 2) CPA Pathway (State-Aware)

- **Submodules**: 150-Hour Planner (education gap analysis); Exam Planner (CPA Evolution: Core + Discipline); Ethics Exam Tracker (where required); Experience Log (supervisor verification); License Application Wizard; CPE Maintenance (credits, deadlines).
- **Step-by-Step**:
  1. Education audit: target 150 semester hours (acct/upper-level mix).
  2. Apply to sit: state board/agency evaluation.
  3. Exams (2024+): Core = AUD, FAR, REG; pick one Discipline (BAR / ISC / TCP).
  4. Ethics exam: if your state requires.
  5. Experience: 1–2 yrs under a licensed CPA (state rules vary).
  6. Apply for license: background check, fees, verification.
  7. Maintain CPE: track hours, renew on time.

### 3) Broker Pathways (Two Tracks)
- **A) Securities Registered Rep / Broker**
  - Submodules: SIE Prep → Member Firm Match; Series Exams (7 + 63/65/66 as needed); Form U4, fingerprints, background; Compliance & Continuing Education tracker.
  - Step-by-Step:
    1. Pass SIE.
    2. Secure firm sponsorship (FINRA member).
    3. Pass Series 7 (+ 63/65/66 depending on role/state).
    4. File U4, fingerprints, disclosures.
    5. Register with state(s) as required.

    4. Apply for MLO license; link to a licensed company.
    5. Add state-specific requirements; maintain CE.

### 4) Myth vs Reality — TreasuryDirect (TDA) Bill Payments
- TDA is not a payment account. It is for buying/holding Treasury securities. Routing bill payments through TDA can be illegal or fraudulent.
- **Teach Instead (safe & real)**:
  - How to redeem/sell a Treasury security → transfer proceeds to a bank account → pay bills from that bank account.
  - Set up ACH/online bill pay via checking account.
  - Treasury timelines (settlement, redemption holds) to plan cash flow.

### 5) “Create Bonds & Present at the Fed Window” — Reality & Legal Path
- Individuals/companies cannot present bonds at the Federal Reserve discount window; it is only for depository institutions.
- **Legitimate Guidance (your app can support)**:
  - Corporate/Muni Bond Issuance Workflow:
    - Form issuing entity; retain securities counsel.
    - Choose route: SEC-registered (S-1) or exempt (Reg D 506(b)/(c), Reg S, Rule 144A to QIBs).
    - Draft Indenture; appoint Trustee; apply for CUSIP; seek DTC eligibility.
    - Prepare OM/Prospectus; audited financials; risk factors.
    - Engage underwriter/placement agent; price/close.
    - Post-issue reporting (if applicable); paying agent setup.
  - Bank-level access to the Fed window requires a regulated depository institution — a different, highly regulated path.

### 6) Debt Discharge / Redemption (Compliant Toolkit)
- **Submodules**: Debt Validation & Timeline Manager (FDCPA/FCRA dates); TILA/FCBA dispute pack; RESPA RFI/QWR for mortgages; Securitization research worksheets; Trustee inquiries; Settlement Offer Builder (lump-sum, payment plans); Evidence Pack (mail proofs, logs, statements); Risk & Compliance scanner.
- **Step-by-Step**:
  1. Intake docs → build account timeline.
  2. Send validation/verification (correct statute cites, deadlines).
  3. If errors → disputes with exhibits; escalate to CFPB/AG as needed.
  4. For mortgages → RFI/QWR; request life-of-loan history.
  5. Evaluate options: cure, workout, refi, settlement, litigation referral.
  6. Track responses; maintain evidence; close loop.
